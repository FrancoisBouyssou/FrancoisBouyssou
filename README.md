ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Francois
- I'm a software quality engineer
- I have experienced different position before to become QA:
- I have started working as support with interaction with users and their issues.
- Next, I was C++/Qt and Python developer
- And then, I granted more responsability in my team as QA and support leader 
- This experiences gave me a global vision of the dev workflow
